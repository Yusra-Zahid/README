# Crypto Trading & Financial Transactions – SQL Analytics Project

This project showcases SQL-based analytics on simulated crypto trading data and financial transactions.  
It is designed to reflect real work done in crypto exchanges and fintechs in markets like Dubai.

## 🔹 Objectives

- Analyze user trading behaviour using `trades` and `users` data.
- Identify top traders by volume, PnL, and win-rate.
- Measure symbol-level volatility (BTCUSDT, ETHUSDT).
- Analyze high-value financial transactions for potential fraud risk.
- Demonstrate SQL skills relevant for crypto, risk, and finance roles.

## 🔹 Files in this Project

- `users_sql.xlsx` – User profile data (country, signup date, KYC status, tier).
- `trades_sql.xlsx` – Trade-level data (symbol, side, price, qty, PnL).
- `financial_transactions_sql.xlsx` – Transaction data for deposits, withdrawals, transfers, with a fraud flag.
- `SQL_queries.sql` – Example SQL queries used to analyze trading and transaction behaviour.
- `insights_summary.md` – Written interpretation of findings from the queries.

## 🔹 SQL Topics Demonstrated

- Joins between user and trade data.
- Aggregations (volume, PnL, win-rate).
- Volatility calculations by symbol.
- Filtering and rule-based fraud detection logic.
- Business-focused insights for risk and product teams.
